# Deft

**One-shot, anti-slop**

*A layered framework for AI-assisted development with consistent standards and workflows.*

## 📝 Notation Legend

Deft uses compact RFC 2119-based notation for requirements. You will see these markers throughout `main.md`, language standards, skills, and the docs below:

- **!** = MUST (required, mandatory)
- **~** = SHOULD (recommended, strong preference)
- **≉** = SHOULD NOT (discouraged, avoid unless justified)
- **⊗** = MUST NOT (forbidden, never do this)

## TL;DR

Deft is a **layered set of standards files plus deterministic `task` tooling** that makes AI-assisted coding significantly more effective. Instead of repeating the same instructions in every AI session, you define your preferences once — from general coding style to project-specific rules — and AI agents follow them. The result: higher-quality code, reproducible workflows, and AI that gets better over time by learning from your patterns.

**Key benefits:** No more "AI forgot my preferences", no more inconsistent code style across AI sessions, no more re-explaining your stack every time.

**Don't have preferences yet?** Deft ships with professional-grade defaults for Python, Go, TypeScript, C++, and common workflows. Use it out of the box and customize later.

**Context-efficient:** Deft keeps AI context windows lean through the [Notation Legend](#-notation-legend) above and lazy-loading — agents only read the files relevant to the current task, not everything at once.

**📍 Roadmap:** See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the development timeline, open issues, and planned work.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Download the installer for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/deftai/directive/releases), run it, and follow the prompts.

> **⬇️ Quick Download** — direct binaries from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/deftai/directive/releases/latest):
> - **Windows:** [`install-windows-amd64.exe`](https://github.com/deftai/directive/releases/latest/download/install-windows-amd64.exe) | [`install-windows-arm64.exe`](https://github.com/deftai/directive/releases/latest/download/install-windows-arm64.exe) (Surface / Copilot+ PCs)
> - **macOS:** [`install-macos-universal`](https://github.com/deftai/directive/releases/latest/download/install-macos-universal) (Intel + Apple Silicon)
> - **Linux:** [`install-linux-amd64`](https://github.com/deftai/directive/releases/latest/download/install-linux-amd64) | [`install-linux-arm64`](https://github.com/deftai/directive/releases/latest/download/install-linux-arm64) (Raspberry Pi / ARM)

> **🌐 Alternative installer — hosted webinstaller:** prefer not to download and run a local binary first? The hosted webinstaller at **<https://webinstaller.fly.dev/>** walks through the same setup in your browser. Trade-off: hosted convenience vs. the local-only install above (the binaries linked here stay on your machine and can be inspected before running). The webinstaller is an alternative path, not the default — for offline / air-gapped environments and security-conscious teams, prefer the local binaries.

> **📢 Cloned manually (no installer)?** Tell your agent: `Read deft/QUICK-START.md and follow it.` It creates your project's `AGENTS.md` and starts the setup flow automatically.

> **🔄 Upgrading from a previous version?** Read [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) before proceeding. **Agents:** ! Read [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) on the first session after a framework update.
>
> **Canonical path (Epic-5/6 #1339 #1340, #1409):** The published installer binary is the single deterministic entrypoint for install and update. For an existing install, the **canonical headless upgrade command** is `deft-install --yes --upgrade --repo-root . --json` — run it from your project root to force-refresh the framework payload, manifest, and AGENTS.md in one shot (drop `--json` for human-readable output). **Layout-aware & git-safe (#1428, #1425):** the upgrade auto-detects which of the two on-disk payload layouts you have — a **vendored** `.deft/core/` (a git-free payload with no nested `.git` of its own; produced by the webinstaller and, as of v0.39.2, by fresh binary-installer installs) or a **clone** payload (a framework checkout that carries its own `.git`, from older installs or a manual `git clone` origin) — and refreshes accordingly: a vendored payload via a git-free tarball file-swap (atomic, with a timestamped backup), a clone via a clone-to-vendored migration. In every case it **never runs git against your own repository**. At the end of a successful run the installer invokes `scripts/doctor.py --session --json`; the doctor reads the `<install>/VERSION` manifest and recommends that exact command when the payload is stale. Legacy paths are **back-compat only**: `task upgrade` / `run upgrade` are metadata-only acknowledgment (they do NOT replace the payload), and submodule updates / legacy doctor surfaces are de-emphasized. See the installer-doctor handoff in the linked epics and [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md).

> **📦 Brownfield adoption:** Adding Deft to an existing project with pre-v0.20 `SPECIFICATION.md` / `PROJECT.md`? See [docs/BROWNFIELD.md](./docs/BROWNFIELD.md) for the migration path (`task migrate:vbrief`) and what to expect.

### 1. Install Deft

**Windows:**
- Download `install-windows-amd64.exe` (or `install-windows-arm64.exe` for Surface / Copilot+ PCs)
- Run it — Windows SmartScreen may warn about an unrecognised publisher; click "More info" then "Run anyway" (code signing is planned for a future release)

**macOS:**
- Download `install-macos-universal` (works on all Macs — Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Make it executable and run:
  ```bash
  chmod +x install-macos-universal && ./install-macos-universal
  ```
- If macOS Gatekeeper blocks the file: right-click then Open, or remove the quarantine attribute:
  ```bash
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine install-macos-universal
  ```

**Linux:**
- Download `install-linux-amd64` (or `install-linux-arm64` for Raspberry Pi / ARM cloud)
- Make it executable and run:
  ```bash
  chmod +x install-linux-amd64 && ./install-linux-amd64
  ```

The installer guides you through choosing a project directory, installs git if needed, vendors the deft framework payload into `.deft/core/` (as of v0.39.2 a git-free deposit with no nested `.git` of its own; older installs and manual `git clone` origins instead carry a framework clone that keeps its own `.git`), wires it into your project's `AGENTS.md`, and creates your user config directory. Either layout is upgraded in place by `deft-install --upgrade`, which auto-detects the payload and never runs git against your own repository.

**Building from source (developers only):** requires Go 1.22+

```bash
go run ./cmd/deft-install/
```

### 2. Set Up Your Preferences

Deft offers two setup paths that produce the same output (`USER.md` + `vbrief/PROJECT-DEFINITION.vbrief.json`) but adapt to different users:

- **Agent-driven** (recommended for most users) — Tell your agent `read AGENTS.md and follow it` to start the Deft setup flow. The agent will ask how technical you are and adapt accordingly.
- **CLI** (for technical users) — `.deft/core/run bootstrap` runs an interactive setup for `USER.md` and `vbrief/PROJECT-DEFINITION.vbrief.json`.

**User config location:**

- Unix / macOS: `~/.config/deft/USER.md`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\deft\USER.md`
- Override: set `DEFT_USER_PATH` environment variable

### 3. Generate a Scope vBRIEF

`.deft/core/run bootstrap` can chain into the scope-vBRIEF interview, or you can create one anytime:

```bash
.deft/core/run spec            # AI-assisted interview -> vbrief/proposed/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.vbrief.json
```

The interview writes a **scope vBRIEF** to `vbrief/proposed/`. `vbrief/*.vbrief.json` files are the source of truth; `.md` files (`PRD.md`, `SPECIFICATION.md`, `ROADMAP.md`) are rendered views generated on demand via `task *:render`. Direct edits to the rendered `.md` files are overwritten on the next render — edit the underlying `.vbrief.json` instead.

Other commands:

```bash
.deft/core/run reset           # Reset config files
.deft/core/run validate        # Check deft configuration
.deft/core/run doctor          # Check system dependencies
.deft/core/run upgrade         # Record the current framework version after updating deft
```

### 4. Build With AI

Ask your AI to build the product/project from your scope vBRIEFs and away you go:

```
Read vbrief/PROJECT-DEFINITION.vbrief.json and the scope vBRIEFs in
vbrief/active/ (or vbrief/pending/ if none are active yet) and implement
the project following deft/main.md standards.
```

### 5. Backlog triage (working an existing backlog)

Already have a populated backlog — an existing project, a brownfield migration, or an upstream issue tracker that has been accumulating? Trigger the refinement workflow's pre-ingest **Phase 0 action menu** with words like **"triage"**, **"work the cache"**, or **"pre-ingest"**. The agent walks each cached candidate through the menu (`accept | reject | defer | needs-ac | mark-duplicate`) and only **accepted** items land in `vbrief/proposed/` — rejected and deferred items are recorded in the audit log without polluting the backlog.

First populate is scoped via flags so the upstream rate limit does not bite:

```bash
task triage:bootstrap -- --limit 50 --state open
```

Why scoped flags? An unbounded populate against a real-sized backlog can drain the shared GitHub GraphQL bucket (see [#976](https://github.com/deftai/directive/issues/976)); the `--limit` / `--state` / `--batch-size` / `--delay-ms` surface keeps the populate inside the REST budget with batched delays. The cache (`task cache:fetch-all`) is REST-backed and reproducible across re-runs — no live `gh issue view` per decision.

Full walkthrough — including the three-tier model (cache → audit log → accepted backlog), the action menu, and how to re-enter triage on subsequent passes — lives in [`docs/getting-started.md` § Working an existing backlog](./docs/getting-started.md#working-an-existing-backlog). The verb-to-outcome reference for every `task triage:*` and `task cache:*` command is in [`commands.md`](./commands.md#backlog-triage--cache-tasks).

## 🪜 Layered Architecture (at a glance)

Deft separates **how the AI behaves** (the rule ladder) from **what to build** (project requirements). Both are summarised here; the full diagram and rationale live in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Rule Hierarchy

Rules cascade with precedence (highest first). This is the **how-the-AI-behaves** ladder:

1. **USER.md** (highest) — your personal overrides (`~/.config/deft/USER.md` on Unix/macOS, `%APPDATA%\deft\USER.md` on Windows)
2. **vbrief/PROJECT-DEFINITION.vbrief.json** — project-specific rules and identity gestalt
3. **Language files** (`languages/python.md`, `languages/go.md`, ...) — language standards
4. **Tool files** (`tools/taskfile.md`, ...) — tool guidelines
5. **main.md** (lowest) — general AI behavior

Note: project **requirements** (`vbrief/specification.vbrief.json` + scope vBRIEFs in `vbrief/{proposed,pending,active,completed,cancelled}/`) describe **what to build** and are deliberately kept on a separate ladder from the rule cascade above. `ROADMAP.md` is the rendered backlog view of those requirements.

## 🌲 Branch policy

Deft enforces a feature-branch policy by default (#746, #747): direct commits to `master`/`main` are blocked and PRs whose `head_ref` equals `base_ref` are refused at the CI gate. The policy is governed by a typed flag on `vbrief/PROJECT-DEFINITION.vbrief.json`:

```json
{
  "plan": {
    "policy": { "allowDirectCommitsToMaster": false }
  }
}
```

Three enforcement surfaces back the rule:

1. **Git hooks** — `.githooks/pre-commit` and `.githooks/pre-push` invoke `scripts/preflight_branch.py`. Activate them with `task setup` (idempotent `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`); verify with `task verify:hooks-installed`.
2. **Pre-commit gate** — `task verify:branch` is wired into the `task check` aggregate so any local pre-commit pass flags a default-branch commit before it lands.
3. **CI** — `.github/workflows/branch-gate.yml` refuses PRs whose `head_ref` equals `base_ref` (catches `master->master` PRs that the local hooks cannot see).

Reconfigure via deterministic tasks (audited to `meta/policy-changes.log`):

- `task policy:show` — display the resolved policy and its source.
- `task policy:enforce-branches` — set `allowDirectCommitsToMaster=false`.
- `task policy:allow-direct-commits -- --confirm` — set the typed flag to `true` after the capability-cost disclosure (branch-protection turns OFF). The deft-directive-setup interview Phase 2 Step 9 elicits the same choice with the same disclosure.

Emergency bypass: set `DEFT_ALLOW_DEFAULT_BRANCH_COMMIT=1` for the current shell. The legacy `Allow direct commits to master:` narrative key is recognised at read time with a deprecation warning and is migrated to the typed surface on the next `task policy:*` write.

See [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md) (Branch-protection policy / Policy audit log entries) for the canonical vocabulary and `skills/deft-directive-setup/SKILL.md` Phase 2 Step 9 for the interview disclosure copy.

## 🔒 Security

Security posture, audit cadence, and vulnerability-reporting flow live in [`docs/security.md`](./docs/security.md). The 2026-05-12 supply-chain hygiene cohort (#1069) recorded the inaugural baseline; future quarterly + event-driven audits append new sections rather than rewrite history. To report a vulnerability, file a private advisory at <https://github.com/deftai/directive/security/advisories/new>.

## ⚙️ Platform Requirements

**GitHub** is the primary supported SCM platform. Skills that interact with issues and PRs (`deft-directive-sync`, `deft-directive-swarm`, `deft-directive-review-cycle`, `deft-directive-refinement`, `deft-directive-release`) require the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) to be installed and authenticated. Core framework features (setup, build, rendering, validation) work independently of any SCM platform.

The migration script (`task migrate:vbrief`) defaults origin provenance to `x-vbrief/github-issue` type. Non-GitHub users should manually adjust `references[].type` in generated vBRIEFs after migration.
